                              Run as usual.


If you are running from CLI:  ADD THE 'mysql-connector-java-8.0.27.jar' TO THE SAME DIR AS YOUR JAVA FILE
                              RUN VIA CLI THE BELOW:

                              java -cp mysql-connector-java-8.0.27.jar <JAVA_FILE_NAME>.java


Clarification:
With the -cp argument you provide the classpath i.e. path(s) to additional classes
or libraries that your program may require when being compiled or run. With -jar
you specify the executable JAR file that you want to run.
