Hi there, this is a project by us, it was not intended to be used as the actual ticketing system.
Feel free to mess things up or customise it. Full Intellij Project at: https://github.com/PIEthonista/FOP-GSC

(under folder 'feats')
Before running, do install MySQL Workbench on your pc or any other IDE that allows database editing.
On your pc, setup a local SQL server (localhost, port:3306), and run the 'FOPGSC Setup.sql' script to
setup the database for the first time. If you feel like you want to revert back to the original database
after a few runs, run 'Reset FOPGSC.sql'.

Some PCs don't show the pretty images & backgrounds when running, for that, unfortunately, you have to
manually copy all the images (PNGs) and paste them in the same directory as the 'Main.java' file.

Also, do add the dependencies in the 'jars' folder to your project if you are using an IDE. Otherwise,
compile them before running them from the CLI.
